# Andy-s-Algorithm
Andy's Algorithm is a set of ImageJ scripts created to simplify the automated batch analysis of biological images.
These scripts can be run on FIJI (https://imagej.net/software/fiji/downloads) for the quantification of cellular antigens and their interactions via antibody-based detection. The following assays that can be analysed include

    DAB IHC
    Proximity Ligation Assays (PLA)
    H&E
    3D colony assays

For more details on the application of these scripts and how to run them please refer to the User Guide and our published paper on Scientific Reports https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-15885-6
